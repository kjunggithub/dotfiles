The latest version can be found here as well:

* http://www.packal.org/workflow/pwgen

## Installation

Download the latest version of the `passwords.alfredworkflow` from the [Releases](https://github.com/otherguy/alfred-generate-password-workflow/releases) page and double click the downloaded file to install it.

The workflow supports automatic updates and will perform daily update checks.

## Caveats and Requirements

This workflow requires [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com) and won‚Äôt run on **Snow Leopard (10.6)** or lower.

## Usage

The default keyword is `pw`. The first and only parameter is the desired password length, defaulting to 20.

When hitting `‚èé Return` on a selected item, the workflow tries to be helpful by opening either the airports website or its Wikipedia page if it has one. If it has neither a website nor an entry in Wikipedia, it opens the Apple Maps.app with the location of the airport.

When holding down a modifier key, the action can be specified:

| Modifier | Action                                           |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `‚å•`      | Open the website of the selected airport.        |
| `ctrl`   | Open the Wikipedia page of the selected airport. |
| `‚åò`      | Show the airports location in Maps.app           |

## `TODO` / Future Work

* Add possibility to change default options

## Developers

If you want to contribute, fork this repository and submit a pull request.

To make the project work locally on your machine, clone the repository, go to the directory and issue the following commands:

    $ pip install --ignore-installed --target=. Alfred-Workflow==1.36
    $ pip install --ignore-installed --target=lib -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, if you would rather work with a virtual environment, run these commands:

    $ virtualenv --python=python2.7 .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the script in the terminal, simply do:

    $ python pwgen.py

You can install `jq` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and pipe the output of the workflow through this program to get nice formatting and the option to query the JSON.
